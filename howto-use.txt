Usage for Chaffer

It occured to me that I had not explained how to use the program.

You'll want to know just how secure is this method. I mention below that this
method is a form of steganography.  Steganography can be very, very secure.  It
depends upon the user and the means of mixing randomness into the information
being transmitted.  I worked in the cryptologic community for a number
of years.  I would not hesitate to use this method to secure information I did not
want compromised to any state actor in the game. That should come with a couple
of caveats though. 

1) Use it with small volumes of text.  
2) Use a grill and throw it away after it is full.
3) Don't use the same key for dozens of pages (10 or less)
4) Change keys frequently.  Don't let them be easily guessed.
5) Difficulties above 3 or 4 should be acceptable.
6) NEVER EVER EVER REUSE A GRILL

A further suggestion is study up on the "transposition" cipher.  Apply that to your 
cipher text if you want more security.  A route transposition would add a lot of
security in a relatively simple operation.  The combination of chaffing and
transposition should predclude traditional "anagramming" and similar attacks.

Explaining how to use the try_me_grill.txt file will also provide a basic understanding
of how chaffing and winnowing work.  In short chaffing is a form of steganography. The
information you wish to hide is not encrypted; rather it is simply "hidden" in the
"noise" of random information.

So lets have a look at the try_me_grill.  The first few lines will be sufficient:

                       Chaff Key: LazyMan, Difficulty: 2

================================================================================
|ERKEL|| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R |
================================================================================
| 000 || r |   | o | p | c |   |   |   | n |   | o |   | u | h | p | i |   |   |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 001 ||   | h | g | t | s | t | l | o | i | e |   | i | M | w | f | e |   |   |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 002 ||   | c |   |   |   | l | m | H |   | t | a | o |   | f | r | t |   | m |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 003 ||   | i |   |   |   |   | 5 |   | n |   |   |   |   | r | e | c |   | r |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Observe the Key was "LazyMan".  This is the phrase used to seed the random
number generator which selects the characters used to chaff the message.  Also
note the Difficulty was set to "2".  This parameter determines how much "chaff"
is applied to a message.  More chaff is usually better but message length is
also a consideration.

So let's let our message be "QUICK RED FOX".  We will encode it by writing it
in our grill thus:

                       Chaff Key: LazyMan, Difficulty: 2

================================================================================
|ERKEL|| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R |
================================================================================
| 000 || r | Q | o | p | c | U | I | C | n | K | o | R | u | h | p | i | E | D |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 001 || F | h | g | t | s | t | l | o | i | e | O | i | M | w | f | e | X | X |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 002 ||   | c |   |   |   | l | m | H |   | t | a | o |   | f | r | t |   | m |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 003 ||   | i |   |   |   |   | 5 |   | n |   |   |   |   | r | e | c |   | r |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have written the message in the grill above and have written it all in caps
so that we can know which letters are message and which are chaff.

You now extract the message and the chaff from the grill and send it to your
friend thus:

000B <= Tells your friend what line and column you started on.  You might
start at 017C, or 003P, or any other line on the page.

Now the message follows:
QopcU ICnKo Ruhpi EDFhg tstlo ieOiM wfeXX 

Again I have left the message text all capitals and the chaff text all lower
case.  I added an "X" to the end of the message to round out the last group
to five letters like all the rest of the groups I sent.

Your friend receives the message and as you send it he writes it down in his
copy of the grill.  Actually he just reads his copy of the grill and whenever
you get to a blank in his grill he writes that letter in the grill.

When you are done sending the message all your friend has to do is simply
READ the message from the grill.  This works best if you copy your message
using a different color ink than the color the grill is printed in...

And that's it.  That's how it is done.  And it *IS VERY* secure when done properly.
